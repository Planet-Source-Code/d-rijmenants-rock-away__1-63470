### Description

Rock Away is a very addictive boardgame with a simple goal: play until only one rock remains in the center of the screen. Simple goal, hard game! If you start losing hope to find a solution, let me tell you this: I first saw the game with a street vendor in Tunesia, who showed me 4 solutions in a nick of time. He told me he knew 12 solutions. I bought the game, believing this was a piece of cake, and spend 2 days finding one solution! I now have great respect for that poor man. I challenge everyone to seek all solutions. Good luck (and lots of time and little sleep). Update 12/8: rewrote game routine (less code) and small undo-routine bug.
